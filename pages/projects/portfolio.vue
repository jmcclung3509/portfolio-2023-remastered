							My previous portfolio, created early 2023, is constructed using Vue, Nuxt,
							and Tailwind. The design process began in Figma, and
							I crafted vector images using Adobe Illustrator.
							Building my portfolio has been an enjoyable journey.
							It marked my first venture into vector image
							creation, which proved to be a valuable learning
							experience. To infuse life into these vector images,
							I converted them into Vue components, enabling
							animations. My primary goal was to achieve a clean
							and user-friendly design, presenting information in
							an organized, easily navigable format.

							My first website, dated 2022, was designed in
							Figma and constructed with Vanilla JavaScript and
							Bootstrap. I embraced a clean and minimalist design
							approach. This project represented one of my initial
							explorations into animation and advanced CSS
							techniques, which involved employing different
							keyframes to animate the hero text upon page load
							and creating captivating hover effects for the
							buttons.
